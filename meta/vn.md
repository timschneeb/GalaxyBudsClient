<tr><td><code>fw_disclaimer_desc</code></td><td>This firmware updating tool is an accurate replica of the official updater found in Samsung's official Android app. I've thoroughly tested this implementation under various circumstances (normal operation, connection loss, intentionally corrupted Bluetooth packets, ...) without experiencing any issues at all. Still, I won't take any liability if anything should go wrong since firmware updates modify vital system components and should always be handled with caution.

DOWNGRADING: While downgrading to older firmware versions is possible and I never ran into problems with it, it may cause unexpected issues and should only be done if necessary. A factory reset after the downgrade is recommended but not usually necessary. 
CUSTOM FLASHING: You are also able to load firmware files from your hard-drive. Do NOT flash firmware binaries designed for OTHER models onto your device.

This application is licensed under GPLv3. By using it, you are accepting the license and its limitation of liability. Press 'Continue' to accept.</td></tr>
